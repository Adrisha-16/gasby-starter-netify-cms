# gasby-starter-netify-cms
Note: This starter uses Gatsby v4.  This repo contains an example business website that is built with Gatsby, and Netlify CMS: Demo Link.  It follows the JAMstack architecture by using Git as a single source of truth, and Netlify for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.
